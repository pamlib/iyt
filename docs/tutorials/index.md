## What is an executor?

An exploit is the use of glitches and software vulnerabilities in Roblox by a player to alter the game or gameplay for an unfair advantage.

Many users believe that the correct term for programs that change Roblox for a player's advantage is "**exploiting**", and others believe "**hacking**" is the correct term. However, **hacking** is the act of *gaining unauthorized access to a system* while **exploiting** is *abusing a vulnerability* to do the same.

## Can I get banned for using an executor?

Use executors at your own risk, always use an alt. Just remember you are breaking the Terms of Service so if you're caught by a Roblox admin, you can kiss your account goodbye. There are some videos where Admins don't care at all when you're exploiting, since they have the attention span of a goldfish.

## Why does my computer say it's a virus?

Antiviruses usually mistake executors as viruses due to their nature. Most (if not all) modern executors work by *injecting* some sort of *DLL* file into Roblox and running Lua code (Scripts) in the environment it creates.

Just make sure you downloaded the executors on their official websites, as other people can skid them and add viruses into them.

If you have **trust issues** don't get an exploit.

## I know that the executor is a false positive, but how am I suppose to download it now?

If you don't know what a false positive is, it means a program is detected as a virus even though it isn't a virus.

!!! example "Windows Solution"
	1. Turn off your antivirus
	2. CTRL + J
	3. Click "Keep dangerous file"

!!! example "Mac Solution"
	I don't have a Mac to test out a solution.

## How do I check if I'm going to get banned in the next banwave, or if I'm tainted?

!!! example "Windows Solution"
	1. Win + R `%appdata%`
	2. Go out of the `Roaming` folder
	3. Go into the `Local` folder
	4. Find the folder named `Roblox`
	5. Open the `Logs` file
	
	If you find an archive file in there open one of them and you'll see if you're tainted
	
	If it says `IsTainted=false` you're basically safe. If it says `IsTainted=true` you'll be banned in the next banwave.

!!! example "Mac Solution"
	I don't have a Mac to test out a solution.

## Why does it say Roblox has been updated, please wait for an un-patch?

Roblox updates every Wednesday or Tuesday (depending on your timezone). The executors at the beginning of this page with a star are my preferred ones you get because they are good and update fast (within five minutes to two hours).

## Why do most free executors have key systems?

The reason for this executor having a key system is to support the developers of the executor (maintaining one is time consuming and hard work), this is for them to keep updating the exploits, domains, and feeding their staff.

## What is FE?

"Why can't I run require(id) scripts?" - 🤡

`Filtering Enabled` is a form of anti-exploiting Roblox has implemented.

Basically, `Filtering Enabled` (`FE`) disables client modification of server values, or in simpler words, the client can't make changes to the game.

As Roblox says: "Enabling `Filtering Enabled` is the best way of restricting exploiters from ruining your games. When it is enabled, with a few exceptions, changes made by clients will not replicate to the server (and therefore will not replicate to other clients). This means, if your game is properly designed, exploiters will find it much harder to operate in your game."

"But my friend said he can disable FE and it's possible!"

Shut up, no it's not. He lied to you, you gullible piece of-

## Can I copy games?

Sorta.

Your executor needs to have a decompiler. Because of `Filtering Enabled` you can not save server scripts, only the map, module scripts, and local scripts.

If your executor has a decompiler you can just run:

```lua
saveinstance()
```

## What is a Workspace folder?

The Workspace folder is a folder that's in your executor's folder. That's alot of folders.

!!! example "How to find it"
	1. Open the folder where your executor is located
	2. Look for a folder named `workspace`
	
	If it doesn't exist, your executor is garbage. Get a executor from the top of this page under `Recommended Executors`.

## What are some safe websites to get scripts?

I recommend you use an adblocker when you visit some of these websites.

## I want to learn how to script Roblox Lua, but how?

First of all, learning how to fully understand scripting is very hard as the progress can take to months, or years.

What you need is dedication, you won't be able to understand the basics in just a day. But if you're autistic enough maybe you will.

<p>If you want to learn how to make simple scripts, and also intermediate ones I'd recommend <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/robloxhackers/comments/ok3hsg/beginners_exploit_guide">wYn#0001's tutorials</a>, the tutorials are very good and he also teaches you how a UI Library works.</p>
