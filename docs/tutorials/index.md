Anything with the ðŸŒŸ emoji are my preferred options. (My opinion, do not expect them to be the best)

## Why do most free executors have key systems?

The reason for this executor having a key system is to support the developers of the executor (maintaining one is time consuming and hard work), this is for them to keep updating the exploits, domains, and feeding their staff.

## What is FE?

"Why can't I run require(id) scripts?" - ðŸ¤¡

`Filtering Enabled` is a form of anti-exploiting Roblox has implemented.

Basically, `Filtering Enabled` (`FE`) disables client modification of server values, or in simpler words, the client can't make changes to the game.

As Roblox says: "Enabling `Filtering Enabled` is the best way of restricting exploiters from ruining your games. When it is enabled, with a few exceptions, changes made by clients will not replicate to the server (and therefore will not replicate to other clients). This means, if your game is properly designed, exploiters will find it much harder to operate in your game."

## Can I copy games?

Sorta.

Your executor needs to have a decompiler. Because of `Filtering Enabled` you can not save server scripts, only module scripts and local scripts.

If your executor has a decompiler you can just run:

```lua
saveinstance()
```
