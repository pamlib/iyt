Many users believe that the correct term for programs that change Roblox for a player's advantage is \" exploiting \", and others believe \" hacking \" is the correct term. However, hacking is the act of gaining unauthorized access to a system while exploiting is abusing a vulnerability to do the same. Can I get banned for using an executor? \u00b6 Use executors at your own risk, always use an alt. Just remember you are breaking the Terms of Service so if you're caught by a Roblox admin, you can kiss your account goodbye. There are some videos where Admins don't care at all when you're exploiting, since they have the attention span of a goldfish. Why does my computer say it's a virus? \u00b6 Antiviruses usually mistake executors as viruses due to their nature. Most (if not all) modern executors work by injecting some sort of DLL file into Roblox and running Lua code (Scripts) in the environment it creates. Just make sure you downloaded the executors on their official websites, as other people can skid them and add viruses into them. If you have trust issues don't get an exploit. I know that the executor is a false positive, but how am I suppose to download it now? \u00b6 If you don't know what a false positive is, it means a program is detected as a virus even though it isn't a virus. Windows Solution Turn off your antivirus CTRL + J Click \"Keep dangerous file\" Mac Solution I don't have a Mac to test out a solution. How do I check if I'm going to get banned in the next banwave, or if I'm tainted? \u00b6 Windows Solution Win + R %appdata% Go out of the Roaming folder Go into the Local folder Find the folder named Roblox Open the Logs file If you find an archive file in there open one of them and you'll see if you're tainted If it says IsTainted=false you're basically safe. If it says IsTainted=true you'll be banned in the next banwave. Mac Solution I don't have a Mac to test out a solution. Why does it say Roblox has been updated, please wait for an un-patch? \u00b6 Roblox updates every Wednesday or Tuesday (depending on your timezone). The executors at the beginning of this page with a star are my preferred ones you get because they are good and update fast (within five minutes to two hours). Why do most free executors have key systems? \u00b6 The reason for this executor having a key system is to support the developers of the executor (maintaining one is time consuming and hard work), this is for them to keep updating the exploits, domains, and feeding their staff. What is FE? \u00b6 \"Why can't I run require(id) scripts?\" - \ud83e\udd21 Filtering Enabled is a form of anti-exploiting Roblox has implemented. Basically, Filtering Enabled ( FE ) disables client modification of server values, or in simpler words, the client can't make changes to the game. As Roblox says: \"Enabling Filtering Enabled is the best way of restricting exploiters from ruining your games. When it is enabled, with a few exceptions, changes made by clients will not replicate to the server (and therefore will not replicate to other clients). This means, if your game is properly designed, exploiters will find it much harder to operate in your game.\" \"But my friend said he can disable FE and it's possible!\" Shut up, no it's not. He lied to you, you gullible piece of- Can I copy games? \u00b6 Sorta. Your executor needs to have a decompiler. Because of Filtering Enabled you can not save server scripts, only the map, module scripts, and local scripts. If your executor has a decompiler you can just run: saveinstance () What is a Workspace folder? \u00b6 The Workspace folder is a folder that's in your executor's folder. That's alot of folders. How to find it Open the folder where your executor is located Look for a folder named workspace If it doesn't exist, your executor is garbage. Get a executor from the top of this page under Recommended Executors . What are some safe websites to get scripts? \u00b6 I recommend you use an adblocker when you visit some of these websites. robloxscripts v3rmillion rscripts I want to learn how to script Roblox Lua, but how? \u00b6 First of all, learning how to fully understand scripting is very hard as the progress can take to months, or years. What you need is dedication, you won't be able to understand the basics in just a day. But if you're autistic enough maybe you will. If you want to learn how to make simple scripts, and also intermediate ones I'd recommend wYn#0001's tutorials , the tutorials are very good and he also teaches you how a UI Library works.","title":"Get Started"},{"location":"tutorials/#recommended-executors","text":"Synapse X (Windows) ($20 USD) \ud83c\udf1f Scriptware (Windows) ($19.99 USD) \ud83c\udf1f Scriptware M (Mac) ($19.99 USD) Scriptware iOS (Free if you purchase Scriptware M) (Apple Devices) KRNL (Free) Fluxus (Free) Oxygen U (Free) \"hello welcoem to infinit tek suport mi nam is toon\" - zach","title":"Recommended Executors"},{"location":"tutorials/#what-is-an-executor","text":"An exploit is the use of glitches and software vulnerabilities in Roblox by a player to alter the game or gameplay for an unfair advantage.
